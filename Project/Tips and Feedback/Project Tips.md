## DON'Ts

Do not use:
- Wordcloud
- Pie charts

Avoid:
- Using a ton of categorical variables (they're hard to represent in large scale - like what happened with the pokemon Vis)
- Graphs that change the variety of attributes to visualize


## DOs



## Interesting Vis Applications
Magnet Vis:
    - Marks = circles
    - Items ~= magnets
    - Repulsion and attraction of items based on value affinity
