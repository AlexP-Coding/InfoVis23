# Color

Humans are sensitive to different wavelenghts.

Luminosity

Hue (Cone cells):
- Red
- Green
- Blue

Brain interprets color as the difference between excitation of cone cell types. 

There are more color cones in Green, then Red, then Blue. There's a lot of overlap between Green and Red.

## Color Models
- RGB:
    - Red, Green, Blue
    - Additive (adding, we get white), cubic
    - Harder to use in InfoVis, since it's a cubic model

- HSV :
    - Hue (color type)
    - Saturation (purity)
    - Value (brigthness)

- HSL:
    - Similar to HSV but with Luminance

If we change value/luminance as well as hue, the information will be color-blind friendly (and also iffy-monitor friendly), even if we do have some redundant encoding :D


## Color Perception
We do not percieve light the same way. If the color distance and perceptual distance differ, we may have a non-linear perception scale. 

This is not relevant unless we wish for great accuracy, in which case we use a CIELAB model.

Placing colors next to one another affects our perception of them (especially since humans compensate for perceived shading).

Color blending does not work except for specific types of colors, and even then it is hard to determine the original value.

Humans can distinguish between at most 12 color hues.
