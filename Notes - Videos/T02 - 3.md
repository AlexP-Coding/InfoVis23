# 3. Data

## 3.1 Dataset Types
Data itself can be abstracted.

### Key Points
Main things to consider:
- Items available
- Attributes of items
- Links between to consider
- Positions (whether they matter)
- Grid (if a grid-like organization is present for the positions)

E.g.: 
- Vis Purpose: identifying taller family members and how blood relations determine it
- Item - family member
- Attributes - height, mother, father, sibling(s)
-  Links? Yes - parenthood
- Position: Irrelevant
- Grid: Irrelevant (esp. since position is irrelevant)

Scallability should be considered as well. Designing for a dynamic dataset makes this especially important.

### Data Types
Depend on the structure the data shows up in.

- Tabular Data:
    - Tables/Equivalent to table (2D, 3D, ... depends on nr of keys per item)
    - Most common
    -  Not necessarily 2 dimensional (3D if it has 2 keys per item, 4D if 3 keys, ...)
- Network/Graph:
    - Nodes connected to each other by some attribute/edge
    - Subtype: Hierarchy/Trees
- Fills/Grids:
    - Set of values throughout space
    - Grid may be finer or coarser
    - Zoom increase relevant
    - May be:
        - Rectangular
        - Structured (with a different yet regular structure)
        - Instructural (shape depends on what dataset requires)
- Geometry:
    - Areas, line tracing position matter
    - Usually seen in georeferencing data

### Attribute Types

- Nominal (categorical) - cannot attach order (e.g.: car brand)
- Ordered - may attach order:
    - Ordinal - there is order, but no quantitative value (e.g.: evaluation - good/bad)
    - Quantitative - order and quantitative value:
        - Ratio - There is a baseline; distance from baseline can be measured/ratio can be established (e.g.: height, with baseline 0m)
        - Continuous - There is no baseline (e.g.: altitude)
    
- Cyclical (e.g.: time)
- Hierarquies (e.g.: DD/MM/YYYY)

### Allowed Visual "Operations"
The picture says it all, really.

### Usage
Attribute type depends on how we wish to interpret the data. 

An attribute may be interpreted differently due to the problem domain.



## 3.2 Data Pre-Processing
Attempt to achieve data quality.

### Fix Missing Values
- Discard entire item (not great if there's not a lot of items)
- Assign sentinel value (value outside of problem domain like -1, and look out for them in the Vis code)
- Assign average value of attribute (good if not hugely different from other dataset values)
- Assign value of the nearest neighbor (e.g.: people close in age and gender to use same height)
- Impute value (statistcly determine most likely value)

### Fix Outliers
Fix:
- Discard item (commonly used, so it does not completely distort the data)
- Represent them independently

Identify:
- Interquartille range (values must be within 1.5 of these quartiles)

### Fix Different Attribute Ranges
- Normalize values of each attribute

### Define Derived Measures
- Identify what we actually want to visualize
- Compute them in code
- LABS: Ideally 3 step computation, like fitbit "compare nr steps" -> "step difference" -> "nr of times nr of steps was in the X ramge"
- Human should not be required to do the bulk of the work
