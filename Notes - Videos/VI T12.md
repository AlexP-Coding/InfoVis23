# Storytelling


## Base
- Add annotations:
    - Left up to interpretation (NOT IDEAL) 

- Impose structure:
    - Hero's Journey

    - Freytag's pyramid (structure w/ highs and lows)

Vis must neither be stactic nor allow the user full freedom, lest the message be lost

## Interaction
- Author driven
- User driven
Ideal: strike a balance

Users will want to know more about the story, and are to do so via interaction

Martini glass structure:
- Author driven at first
- Resolution be user driven

Slideshow/Wizard approach:
- Major steps predefined
- Inside each step, the user can fuck around

Drill down:
- Present users with overview
- User can zoom in the different parts

## Making It Work
Let the user know where the main points are. Use dynamic:
- Headings
- Captioning
- Annotations
We may need traditional text as well (like with comics), have it be integrated.
Vis helps understand text, text gives context to better interpret data

Steps:
- Explain setting
- Building tension
- Descending action (toward conclsion)

Scrolly-telling is useful too! Usually it's animated.
