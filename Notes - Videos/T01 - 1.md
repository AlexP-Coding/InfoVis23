# 1. Introduction

## 1.1A. What is InfoVis

### Importance of InfoVis
- Understanding large amounts of data / datasets
- Understand data correlation through non-mathematical means
- Use that understanding to make decisions
- We may be fooled by vis if we do not understand InfoVis

### Definition
- Convey information:
    - Through visual channels (helps us gain information faster)
    - That will be used for a given purpose (learning, help carrying out a task...)
    - To be viewed by a human in the loop (so we need to understand what the human needs)
    - To be transmited through a computer in the loop (has interactivity component, has animations to change viewpoint w/o loosing analysis context...) - this is for the most recent century



## 1.1B. Approach to InfoVis

Focus on expressiveness based on what we need. 

The Vis:
- Is custom-made
- Answers concrete questions
- Gives actionable information (for carrying out concrete tasks)

The visual representation is not always the same for the same types of data; it depends on its purpose.

For SciVis, there is faithfulness for data position; InfoVis does not have that constraint.


## 1.2A. Classical Examples
- John Snow colera case:
    - Wanted to know origin of colera epidemic
    - Plotted infected homes and water pumps
    - Found specific water pump was the motive (most infected homes clustered around it)

- Nurse Florense:
    - Wanted to prove people were dying from disease, not war
    - Drew wedge pie chart with main causes of death per month (battle wounds, disease, and other)
    - Showed most people were dying from disease

- Napoleon:
    - Wanted to show evolution of Napoleon's attemt at Russia
    - Drew path to and from Russia and temperature throughout the journey
    - Showed Napoleon's men died more in harsh weather

- Poverty map:
    - Wanted to reduce bias
    - Drew map showing poor and rich families' houses
    - Showed poor people aren't the only ones facing the main street

- London map:
    - Wanted to help people travel better
    - Drew map only with straight lines and intersections
    - Made more understandable map which allowed more stations to be built

## 1.2B. Modern Examples
- NameVoyager: 
    - Chart to show popularity of top 100 most popular US names in the past 200 years
    - Interactivity 
    - There are related names for specific research

- Death by age:
    - Line chart
    - Interactivity

- Music Timeline:
    - Sting graph to show music popularity throughout the years
    - Interactity (subgenres...)

- 2011 Federal Budget proposal:
    - Treemap (hierarchy), values inside category
    - Color encoded (by decrease-increase)

- Music Croemer:
    - Nodelink-graph, artists connected to each other
    - Interactivity (clicking on sub-node shows its connections)
    - Overview/Zoom in feature

- Movies social networks:
    - Nodelink, social connection of characters per movie
    - Node size and color encoding
    - Large node/edge number makes vis harder to understand

- Netflix Queues:
    - Georeference dataset (with locations, roads...) used with map vis, frequency of movie renting per state
    - Vis lends itself to comparisons a lot
    - List with visual preview (rather than just the name) facilitates comparison and makes things easier to understand

- London Surnames:
    - Map, see top 10 most frequent surnames

- Others:
    - Vis for text-based databases
    - Windmap


### Usually bad things on vis
- Volume
- Perspective/depth effects
- Incomprehensive/Poor scale
