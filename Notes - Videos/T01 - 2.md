# 2. Vis Basics

## 2.1 Crafting the Vis

### The Three Big Questions

- WHAT: 
    - What type of data will be shown
    - What type of patterns we want to see

- WHY: 
    - Why we want to show that data
    - Questions and their abstract form

- HOW:
    - How to visualy encode the data

### The Process
1. Domain - Define problem domain:
    - "Difference between students now vs 2020" is not great, "comparing entry grade distribution between them" is best
    - Understand the users (interviews,  questionnaire, observation...):
        - Which questions/tasks do they have?
        - What do they know beforehand?
        - What vocabulary do they expect to see?
2. Abstraction (What, Why) - Come up with a good data abstraction:
    - Abstract data (e.g.: entry grade distribution -> compare continuous quantitative variables)
    - Advantage: user already knows how to interpret Vis and we do not need a second one to represent data
3. Idiom (How)- Decide idiom/Video encoding
4. Algorithm - Decide on implementation


## 2.1A Choosing the Idiom
Consider:
- **Abstraction** and domain tasks (pick best idiom for the job)
- Scalability (depending on dataset size)
- Organization (part of website, several idioms at once...)
- Interactivity (if they animations support the interactivity, and help understand the data rather than distract)
- Users (base representations understood by the general public)


## 2.1B Pitfalls
- Aesthetic over data understanding
- Being mandatory to have the values written out for the Vis to be understandable
- Not accounting for scallability (test out with the entire dataset as soon as possible):
    - Of visuals 
    - Of interactivity (so animation is not as slow to hinder understanding)
- Refusal to iterate

### How to Start
- Top-Down (most common): from domain to algorithm 
- Bottom-up (create a Vis, see what may be abstracted from it and what tasks that helps with) 


## 2.2 Task Abstraction

Main idea: come up with domain-independent tasks / design patterns

### Task Categories
Analysis:
- consume info:
    - discover new things (form hypothesis and test if they're true)
    - present information (show others what we've discovered), like infographics
    - enjoyment
- produce info:
    - annotate data (datasets can be added to)
    - recording data (record data, like with sensors)
    - derive new things (during the analysis as the attribute is required)
Searching:
- lookup (know target and its location)
- Browse (target unknown, location known)
- Locate (target known, target location - relative or otherwise - not known)
- Exploration (target and location unknown)

    |  Location\Target | **Known**  | **Unknown** |
    |---------------------|--------------|----------------|
    | **Known**            | Lookup       |  Browse         |
    | **Unknown**        | Locate       | Exploration    |

Querying:
- identify (get certain items)
- compare (items)
- summarize (get overal view of items)

A single Vis can support multiple task types


### To Identify

- Which are the targets
- What can we wish to find in Vis:
    - Trends (locate them, analyse them...)
    - Outliers (e.g.: distribution)
    - Dependencies (e.g.: correlations)
    - Similarities
    - Topology (what's connected to what, if there's cycles, ...)
    - Paths between nodes (e.g.: if two people are related through somewhere)
