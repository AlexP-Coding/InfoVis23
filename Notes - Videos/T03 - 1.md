# Marks and Channels

How to visually encode attributes?

We must base ourselves in the similar way humans sense and perceive the world.

So, we have some guidelines on what visual encodings for data work best, based on what humans perceive:
- Better
- More easily
- More meaningfully

## Pre-Attentive Processing
We don't need to pay attention to everything in order to understanding. There's lots of pre-processing done on the bottom of our retina, to detect:
- Patterns
- Textures
- Movements

This is done in a pre-attentive way (within 250ms). We don't need to pay attention to identify some concepts.

If we have a pre-attentive attribute, we can make identifying Vis targets much more efficient and faster because we can do it at a glance.

### Pre-Attentive Attributes
Researchers keep looking into them and finding new ones.

Mixing pre-attentive attributes makes things harder to identify. Some are more dominant over other, such as color over shape.

Form
- Line orientation
- Line length
- Line width
- Line collinearness
- Size
- Curvature
- Spatial grouping
- Blur 
- Added Marks
- Numerosity
- Shape

Color:
- Hue
- Intensity

Motion:
- Flicker
- Direction

Spatial position:
- 2D pos.
- Stereoscopic depth
- Convex/Concave shape from shading


We must first think of the marks, then of the channels

## Marks
- Discrete visual element (e.g.: circle, line)
- Encodes one value
- 3 main types: 
    - 0D, Points
    - 1D, Lines 
    - 2D, Areas

## Channels
- Way in which a mark can vary (e.g.: vary line's slope, color hue, ...)
- E.g.:
    - Position (x, y)
    - Shape
    - Color hue...

One channel typically encodes 1 attribute/variable.

Here, we have 4 channels encoding 4 attributes in each mark, through:
- Size
- Color hue
- Xpos
- Ypos

If we encode too much info/too many channels, things may get confusing, even for "normal" attentive marks

Channels that:
- Have intrinsic order (e.g.: color saturation) should encode attributes with intrinsic order (e.g.: height)
- Don't have intrinsic order (e.g.: color hue) should enconde attributes without intrinsic order (e.g.: food types).
Else, we risk misleading the audience.

## Choosing attributes
We should consider:
- Attribute type
- Accuracy (of the data we wish to represent):
    - Difficult, since human perception is logarithmic for all channels except length (which we perceive linearly)
    - S = I^(n), so if we want double the sensitivity, we must adapt the scale
    - If the values and amount of values encoded isn't as valued

- Discriminability:
    - Recognizing there's different values being encoded (e.g.: shape works well)
    - How many different values should the user be able to recognize
    - Each channel can encode up to K values/bits before we start mixing them up

## Great Principles
### Expressiveness Principle
The visual encoding should express all of, and only, the information in the attributes:
- If the attributes do not have order, then the encoding should not have order
- The scale (color scale, e.g.) should reflect the information present

### Effectiveness Principle
The importance of the attribute should match the salience of the channel.

This way, users pay attention to the more important attributes best.

### Webber's Law
Our perception is based on relative judgments. 

We should also be careful with:
- Mark proximity
- Mark alignment
They both distort perception. This is especially important for comparisons.

We should choose channels based on if they will mix well with each other.

### Domain-Specific Meaning
Users have specific expectations regarding some channels. For example, in temperature, blue may mean cold and red mean hot.

If we match those expectations, visualization is faster and less misleading.
