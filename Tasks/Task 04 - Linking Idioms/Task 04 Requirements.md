    - `Implement  a  tooltip  showing  country's  name,  incomeperperson,  alcconsumption,  and  employrate. This tooltip appears next to the mouse pointer when the user hovers a mark. You also  must create a drawer section at the bottom of the page. Whenever you click on a mark, the country's name is added to the drawer. Clicking on it again (either in the drawer or a mark) removes it from the drawer.`
